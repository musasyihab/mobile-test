# Timeline Page - Frontend Test v1.1

__You're a mobile developer for a new MedicTrust project.__

Our CEO wants a new timeline page. The project manager hands you a file from our UX designer, along with some notes from the Project Planning Meeting where the details of the page were (sort of) ironed out. Immediately, you went to your workstation and open the design:

Pretty neat! However, when you look at the notes you think (quietly, to yourself, of course):

User Experience : [Invision](https://invis.io/U34LY9U7D)
Assets : - [Screen 1](http://www.freeimages.com/photo/misty-morning-4-1384194)

**You:**
> Hm, this specification is more than a little vague and weird in spots.

The notes read:

  2. Implement api.
  3. (Bonus) Creativity
  4. (Bonus) Consistent code style
